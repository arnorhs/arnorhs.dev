# Security Policy

Note: the project is run in a static site generation context, so there shouldn't be any server or running process to be aware of, so that is not really
of much concern when it comes to this project. Also, since this is my personal website, I'm not invested in keeping track of possible security 
vulnerabilities besides those automatically reported by dependabot.

## Supported Versions

This project does not use semantic versioning. If reporting a security issue, please refer to the git sha hash of the commit you used.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report secuirty vunlerabilities to arnorhs@gmail.com
