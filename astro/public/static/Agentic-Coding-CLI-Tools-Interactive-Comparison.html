    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard application with tab-based navigation. This structure was chosen to allow users to easily switch between different views of the data (high-level overview, deep-dive profiles, direct comparison) without losing context. The flow is designed to guide the user from a broad market understanding (Overview), to specific tool details (Tool Profiles), to a multi-faceted comparison (Feature Comparison & Recommendations). This non-linear exploration is more effective for a comparative report than a simple linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        1. Report Info: Overall tool characteristics -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Radar Chart -> Interaction: Toggle tools on/off -> Justification: Provides an immediate, multi-axis visual summary of each tool's strategic strengths and weaknesses, which is more impactful than reading paragraphs of text. Library: Chart.js.
        2. Report Info: Feature Matrix -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Interactive HTML Table -> Interaction: Filter columns by selecting tools -> Justification: The full report matrix is too dense. A filterable table allows users to create focused, side-by-side comparisons of only the tools they are interested in, dramatically improving usability. Library: Vanilla JS.
        3. Report Info: Tool Profiles -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: Tabbed content layout -> Interaction: Click tool name to view its detailed profile -> Justification: Organizes the large amount of information for each tool into a clean, single-view layout, preventing overwhelming scrolling and making information easy to locate. Library: Vanilla JS.
        4. Report Info: Recommendations -> Goal: Guide -> Viz/Method: Interactive Cards -> Interaction: Click persona to reveal recommendations -> Justification: A more engaging and task-oriented way to present recommendations than a static list. Library: Vanilla JS.
