So I decided to re-open my blog. I kind of lost interest in blogging for a while and didn't even remember to renew the domain name. But I did put in the work to import the blog posts from wordpress to here.

So this is my new blog. Maybe I'll post more, maybe I won't.

It's built with Svelte / Sapper and the source code is on github:
[blog source](https://github.com/arnorhs/arnorhs.dev)

Honestly, the only reason I built this is to test Svelte out a little bit.
