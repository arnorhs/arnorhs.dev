I ported [a bunch of my npm modules](https://github.com/arnorhs/arnorhs-packages) to
Typescript and into a monorepo.

Build tools are still a pain. Even though there are some things that have
made things simpler such as Vite and snowpack.

[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) is pretty exciting - I have been working on some projects in solid.

I'm also excited about [astro][/posts/2021-10-29/astro-static-site-builder-of-dreams/], obviously.

I want to write more blog posts in 2022.

In react land the story is finally becoming complete with
[Next.js 11](https://nextjs.org) etc. I'm super excited about [Remix](https://remix.run) as
well. I'm currently pretty down on Gatsby, mostly because of how complicated it is compared
to the other options, though server side rendering seems exciting.

I intend to try out:

- [trpc](https://trpc.io/)
- [magic.link](https://magic.link/)
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)

I'm still really into netlify, although I'm looking more towards
Clourflare and [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) right now

That is it for now.
