title: React - Framework or a library?
summary: '
  I feel like we never really settled debate of whether or not React was a library or a
  framework - hotly debated topic 10 years ago.

  Did it matter? Does it matter now? Here are my thoughts'

## Is React a framework or a library?

I used to say it was a library.. or view engine, or maybe a display-thingamobob..
Not so sure I'd still say so.

I think today, esp. since randos are now convinced React is not a framework but
that next.js/remix/etc are the frameworks, I think I want to say it's a
framework - not only because I'm contrarian by nature.

I have updated my mental model of what I think a "framework" in software
development is. To me a framework is just "a structure" - if you have a structure, a known
structure, that you adhere to.. you have a framework.

## Structure

The structure can be made up of file conventions, some core bit of code that allows for
the file structure to exist, etc.

And you can have multiple frameworks, at the same time, some that you borrow, some
that you install, some that you just prefer.. it's just a structure

Some frameworks are way more structured than others. and way more opinionated about
everything, and some are more open ended.

## In conclusion

A framework is a code structure that births organization of code and convention.

That's it
